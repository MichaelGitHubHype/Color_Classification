# The Project
Simple side project to create a model to classify between colors, using concepts learned from the lab project in the Facebook PyTorch Scholarship! 

# Goal
The project is meant to be devloped into an android app in order to be able to classify a greater number of colors to help color-blind people using a simple app. 

# Currently 
The trained model is able to classify between images between black, blue, green, red, white and yellow on a basic level, with approximately 40 data points collected individually. 

# How to run
Simply clone the project, unzip the data file and work with the notebook!
